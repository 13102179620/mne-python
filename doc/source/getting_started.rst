Getting Started
===============

MNE is written in pure Python making it easy to setup of
any machine with Python >=2.4, Numpy >= 1.1 and Scipy >= 0.6.

To test that everything worked properly, open up IPython::

    ipython
    
Although all of the examples in this documentation are in the style 
of the standard Python interpreter, the use of IPython is highly 
recommended.  Then type::

    >>> import mne

If you get a new prompt with no error messages, you should be good to go.
