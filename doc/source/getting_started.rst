Getting Started
===============

Inside the Martinos Center
--------------------------
People within the MGH/MIT/HMS Martinos Center should follow
`internal instructions <getting_started_at_martinos.html>`_.

MNE is *already installed* on your system.

Outside the Martinos Center
---------------------------

MNE is written in pure Python making it easy to setup of
any machine with Python >=2.4, Numpy >= 1.1 and Scipy >= 0.6.

To test that everything works properly, open up IPython::

    ipython
    
Although all of the examples in this documentation are in the style 
of the standard Python interpreter, the use of IPython is highly 
recommended.  Then type::

    >>> import mne

If you get a new prompt with no error messages, you should be good to go.
