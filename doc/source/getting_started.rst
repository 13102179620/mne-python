Getting Started
===============

Inside the Martinos Center
--------------------------
People within the MGH/MIT/HMS Martinos Center should follow

.. toctree::

    ./getting_started_at_martinos

MNE is *already installed* on your system.

Outside the Martinos Center
---------------------------

MNE is written in pure Python making it easy to setup of
any machine with Python >=2.5, Numpy >= 1.4 and Scipy >= 0.6.

For a free, fast and up to date scientific Python environment you
can install EPD Free available at:

http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php

To test that everything works properly, open up IPython::

    ipython

Although all of the examples in this documentation are in the style
of the standard Python interpreter, the use of IPython is highly
recommended.  Then type::

    >>> import mne

If you get a new prompt with no error messages, you should be good to go.
